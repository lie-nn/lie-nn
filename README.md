# lie-nn

Goals:
* Compute tensor products for several Lie groups (SO(3), O(3), SU(2), SO(1,3)) in [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [jax](https://github.com/google/jax).
* Implement basic tools for equivariant neural networks for several Lie groups : Linear and Gated non linearities.
