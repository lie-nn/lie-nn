# Lie-nn
### Todo :
Strat : Do as much as possible with numpy!
Implement in jax and torch : 1. TP(irreps,irreps)->irreps, Linear(irreps), Gate(irreps)

Ilyes :
1. Finish SU(N) with CG
2. Implement SL(N,C)
3. Lie Algebra => Dynkin diagrams and implement types of Algebra with branching rule :
    1. Generic class for GT_patterns
    2. Each Algebra type has one GT_pattern
4. Possible implement CG type for generic GT_pattern? Are ladder operators generic?

Mario :
1. Reduced Tensor Product (reduire par rapport GxS_N -> SYM[])
2. Finish TP rep with dispatch
3. Conjugaison
4. Change of basis
